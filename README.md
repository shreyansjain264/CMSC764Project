# CMSC764Project

- Max approx for 10-layer NN with cross entropy, MSE, and L1 smooth loss function
- Optimizes for 4 models for each loss function for each of the following weight adjustments to the max approximate [0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2,0.5]
- outputs data (loss over iteration and each models final weights) to a folder in the specified directory on the first line.
